An attempt to get a [fwdpp](http://github.com/molpopgen/fwdpp)-based simulation running in python via [Cython](htpp:://cython.org).

[fwdpp](http://github.com/molpopgen/fwdpp) comes with examples using [boost python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/boost.python/HowTo).  Boost python works well/easily in this case.  Cython is much harder (for me, so far), but it has more "cool kids street cred" at the moment, apparently...
